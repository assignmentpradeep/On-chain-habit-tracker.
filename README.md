# On-chain Habit Tracker

## Project Description
The **On-chain Habit Tracker** is a decentralized platform that allows users to track and maintain their habits securely on the blockchain. By leveraging smart contracts, users can ensure the immutability and transparency of their habit data.

## Project Vision
The vision of the On-chain Habit Tracker is to empower individuals with a trustless and verifiable system for habit tracking. By utilizing blockchain technology, users can remain accountable and committed to their personal growth without relying on centralized platforms.

## Future Scope
- **Token Rewards:** Introduce incentives for users who maintain long habit streaks.
- **Habit Sharing:** Allow users to share their progress with a community.
- **Gamification:** Add achievements and leaderboards for motivation.
- **Cross-Chain Integration:** Expand to multiple blockchain networks for broader accessibility.

## Key Features
- **Immutable Habit Records:** Ensures permanent and tamper-proof habit tracking.
- **Streak Tracking:** Automatically tracks daily completions.
- **User Ownership:** Users have complete control over their data.
- **Transparent and Secure:** All interactions are stored on-chain for full transparency.
- **Simple and Efficient:** Lightweight smart contract design for cost-effective habit tracking.

This project is designed to revolutionize the way habits are tracked by integrating blockchain technology for an entirely decentralized and trustless experience. The smart contract is built without relying on OpenZeppelin, ensuring a fully custom implementation.
